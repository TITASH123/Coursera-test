    <p class="stylingfont">&quot; Student orientation or new student orientation (often encapsulated into an Orientation week, Frosh Week, Welcome Week or Freshers' Week is a period of time at the beginning of the academic year at a university or other tertiary institution during which a variety of events are held to orient and welcome new students. The name of the period varies by country.Although usually described as a week, the length of this period varies widely from university to university and country to country, ranging from about three days to a month or even more (e.g. four or five weeks, depending on program, at Chalmers). The length of the week is often affected by each university's tradition as well as financial and physical constraints. During this period, students participate in a wide range of social activities, including live music and other performances, sports challenges, stunts, and open-air markets.&quot;</p>

    <p class="stylingfont">&quot; The first day at college is indeed the most important day in any students life. It is a very daunting experience one has to face because the world in college life is more unportected and dangerous. One gets introduced to the course work, meets new students from different parts of the country, learns about subjects never learnt before and developes a general idea about the enviornment which is going to be his home for the next few years. There are both pleasent and unpleasent experiences one has to face in this process and in the end one evolves as an adult who has learnt to face it the hard way. Its important to maintain a good rapport with the teachers in order to continue getting their blessings.&quot;</p>

       <li> Realize your fear is in your head 
       <p class="stylingfont">The first step is to develop a healthy mental image of meeting new people. Some of us see meeting new people as a scary event. We are concerned about making a good impression, whether the other person will like us, how to keep the conversation going, and so on. The more we think about it, the scarier it seems. This initial apprehension develops into a mental fear, which takes a life of its own and unknowingly blocks us from making new friends. Shyness toward others is actually a result of fear. Actually all these fears are just in our head. If you think about it, about 99% of people are too busy being concerned over the exact same things about themselves to pay attention to you. They’re just as scared as you are.  The remaining 1% are people who recognize a relationship is built on way stronger values than specific words or things said/done during just 1 encounter. Even if there are people who do judge you on what you do/say, are these people you want to be friends with? I think not.</p>
       </li>


	   <li>Start small with people you know
		<p>If you haven’t been socializing much, meeting a whole bunch of new people may intimidate you. If that’s the case, start small first. Lower down the difficulty of the task by starting off with your inner circle of friends – i.e. people you are more familiar with. Some ways to do that are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Reach out to acquaintances. Have any hi-bye type friends from earlier years? Or friends you lost touch with over time? Drop a friendly sms and say hi. Ask for a meet-up when they are free. See if there are opportunities to reconnect.</p></li>
        <li><p>See if there are cliques where you can join in. Cliques are established groups of friends. The idea isn’t to break into the clique, but to practice being around new friends. With cliques, the existing members will probably take the lead in conversations, so you can just take the observatory role and watch the dynamics between other people.</p></li>
		<li><p>Get to know your friends’ friends. You can join them in their outings or just ask your friend to introduce you to them. If you are comfortable with them you might like to spend time with them.
		</p></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Get yourself out there<p>Once you acquaint yourself more with your inner circle of friends, the next step will be to extend it outward to people you don’t know.Join meet-up groups. Meetup.com is a great social networking site. There are many interest groups, such as groups for entrepreneurs, aspiring authors, vegetarian, boardgame lovers, cycling enthusiasts, etc. Pick out your interests and join those groups. Meet-ups are usually monthly, depending on the group itself. Great way to meet a lot of new people quickly.</p></li>
		<li>Attend workshops/courses. 
		<p>These serve as central avenues that gather like-minded people. I went to a personal development workshop last year, and there I met with many great individuals, some of whom I became good friends with.</p></li>
		<li>Volunteer.<p> Great way to kill 2 birds with one stone – not only do you get to spread kindness and warmth, you meet compassionate people with a cause.</p></li>
		<li>Go to parties. <p>Parties such as birthday parties, christmas/new year/celebration parties, housewarmings, function/events, etc. Probably a place where you’ll meet a high quantity of new friends but not necessarily quality. Good way to meet more people nonetheless.</p></li>
		<li>Visit bars and clubs. <p>Many people visit them to meet more friends, but I don’t recommend them as the friends you make here are probably more hi-bye type, rather than the type #2 and type #3 friends. It’s good to just visit them a couple of times and see how they’re like before you make your judgment.</p></li>

    <header>FALLING IN LOVE</header>
    <img class="displayed" src="love_html.jpg" width="700" height="435" alt="Picture with a quote" align="middle">
    <p class="stylingfont">&quot; The use of the term "fall" implies that the process is in some way uncontrollable and risky - as in the phrases "to fall ill" or "to fall into a trap" - and that it leaves the lover in a state of vulnerability.For a most basic unswerving example it can be stated in third person that Priya loves Mayank though it may not be mandatory that otherwise of the proclamation of this statement may be true, i.e. Mayank may or may not love Priya while she might be in love with Mayank.It may also reflect the importance of the lower brain centers in the process, which can lead the rational, accounting brain to conclude (in John Cleese's words) that "this falling in love routine is very bizarre....It borders on the occult"&quot;</p>
