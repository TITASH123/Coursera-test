	<header>ORIENTATION !</header>
    <p>&quot; Student orientation or new student orientation (often encapsulated into an Orientation week, Frosh Week, Welcome Week or Freshers' Week is a period of time at the beginning of the academic year at a university or other tertiary institution during which a variety of events are held to orient and welcome new students. The name of the period varies by country.Although usually described as a week, the length of this period varies widely from university to university and country to country, ranging from about three days to a month or even more (e.g. four or five weeks, depending on program, at Chalmers). The length of the week is often affected by each university's tradition as well as financial and physical constraints. During this period, students participate in a wide range of social activities, including live music and other performances, sports challenges, stunts, and open-air markets.&quot;

  <header>FIRST DAY !</header>
     <p>&quot; The first day at college is indeed the most important day in any students life. It is a very daunting experience one has to face because the world in college life is more unportected and dangerous. One gets introduced to the course work, meets new students from different parts of the country, learns about subjects never learnt before and developes a general idea about the enviornment which is going to be his home for the next few years. There are both pleasent and unpleasent experiences one has to face in this process and in the end one evolves as an adult who has learnt to face it the hard way. Its important to maintain a good rapport with the teachers in order to continue getting their blessings.&quot;

  	<header>FALL IN LOVE !</header>
    <p>&quot; The use of the term "fall" implies that the process is in some way uncontrollable and risky - as in the phrases "to fall ill" or "to fall into a trap" - and that it leaves the lover in a state of vulnerability.For a most basic unswerving example it can be stated in third person that Priya loves Mayank though it may not be mandatory that otherwise of the proclamation of this statement may be true, i.e. Mayank may or may not love Priya while she might be in love with Mayank.It may also reflect the importance of the lower brain centers in the process, which can lead the rational, accounting brain to conclude (in John Cleese's words) that "this falling in love routine is very bizarre.It borders on the occult"&quot;
